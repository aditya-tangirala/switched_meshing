# Switched Meshing
#### Contains a prototype that demonstrates how switched meshing would greatly improvise the network performance at times when the network load is extremely high.

### Techonologies Used
#### This aim of the project is to understand the architecture of the Local area Network used at small organization and simulate the same Network using Netsim Network Simulator.After successful simulation, the analysis of the network and identification of the bottlenecks in the Network is done.
